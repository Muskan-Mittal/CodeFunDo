# CodeFunDo
This project aims to target the high school students who face difficulty to understand the concepts of solid state.
It contains 3D models which clearly help to visualise the objects. **A-Frame** framework and **Javascript** language is used. 
This can be extended and used for learning purpose in many topics such as: <br/>
1.Solid State (crystal lattices and their packing )    <br/> 2.Coordinate Systems (Circular cylindrical and Spherical Coordinate systems) <br/> 3.3D geometry(planes and angles) .
