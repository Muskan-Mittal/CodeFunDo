# Unit Cell - Easiest way to learn Solid State

This project aims to target the high school students who face difficulty to understand the concepts of Solid State.
It contains 3D models which clearly help to visualise the different unit cell structures. It will help them to easily understand the calculations for packing fraction, number of nearest neighbours, etc. **A-Frame** framework and **Javascript** language is used. 

## Requirements

VR Headset

## Some more Applications

This idea can be extended and used for learning purpose in many topics such as:

1.&nbsp;Coordinate Systems (Circular, Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinate Systems) 

2.&nbsp;3D Geometry(Planes and Angles) 

3.&nbsp;Vectors
